About the Project
--------------------

FabScan is an open source 3D laser scanner. The `project <https://fabscan.org>`_ started in 2010 at
`Germany's first FabLab in Aachen <http://hci.rwth-aachen.de/fablab>`_. The FabScan PI is the next generation of the FabScan 3D Laser Scanner
and since 2015 Mario Lukas took over as the lead developer of the project. The project is a community and spare time driven project.

Even if it looks like a team of many people is working in it, mostly only two or three people are working on the
current branch ( please thing about it while you are waiting for support ).

The core of the project is based on a Raspberry Pi and a Raspberry Pi camera module. With those components the scanner
can be driven standalone. It can be controlled over a web-enabled frontend.
