Troubleshooting

If you have some problems with the software have a look at the `Software F.A.Q section <https://fabscan.org/f-a-q/>`_ in the community forum. A
lot of common problems are already solved. Otherwise feel free to open a new topic in the forum.

When you think that you found a software related bug, you can report it by opening an issue on `GitHub <https://github.com/mariolukas/FabScanPi-Server/issues>`_.
